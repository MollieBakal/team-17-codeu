    <h1>CodeU Starter Project</h1>
    <p>This is the landing page for our project!</p>
    <p>We decided to create a platform for people to anonymously ask advice from people they know, in a "following" one-way relationship. Our project advisor suggested that we not do the usual unguided projects. Instead, we worked towards this concept.</p>
    <p>Mollie added the ability to respond to messages, creating a comment chain. She also added the ability to add formatting to text via whitelisted HTML because it seemed like a good way to make the project a bit friendlier and more expressive.</p>
    <p>Sneha and Duncan, you guys should put a description of what you've done here</p>
    <p>We suggest you go to /feed.html to see the public prototype--eventually, one option for messages would allow people to ask either their advisors or a public feed of everyone.</p>
